Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors."
